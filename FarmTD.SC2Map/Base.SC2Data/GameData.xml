        ! IMPORTANT NOTE !
        You can _NOT_ modify this file while your project
        is open in sc2edit.
        Even if the Data editor is closed.

        The reason this is important to note and remember, is that
        the same is not true for scripts or layouts.
        They can be modified, added, removed, etc, however you please
        while the editor is running.

        You need to:
        1. Close your project in sc2edit
        2. Open this file and change it
        3. Make the necessary changes to the files in GameData/
        4. If you add new files, you need to add the standard
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="us-ascii"?>
<Catalog>
</Catalog>
        (and remember to save as UTF8 with LF line endings.)
        5. Make sure you save everything, and that all filenames match
        6. Close this file and then reopen your project in sc2edit
