# Farm TD
The project for the Starcraft 2 arcade map Farm TD (Initially created by Timws, now maintained by me, DeltaHit)

This project was partially updated according to the best practices described here: https://sc2mapster.github.io/mkdocs/setup/


## How do I open this project?
- You have to put the contents of this repo into a folder called "Farm_TD.SC2Map". (The name doesn't matter, but the ".SC2Map" does)
- You can now open the folder as a project inside the SC2 Editor.
